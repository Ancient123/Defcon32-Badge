# Build Guide

Your badge should come with all surface mount parts attached to the board. You may need to attach the battery pack to the rear of the board, depending on how much time we have to assemble things.

If you have an unassembled kit, please follow the guide below.

### Build Guide

Step 1 - Please check you have all parts. You should have a main pcb, a front panel, a screen, two led diffusers, a screen support, a lcd / tv frame, 4 brass spacers, 8 screws, and some double sticky tape. You may also have a rotaty encoder and battery holder to solder onto the pcb, depending on how much we can get assembled ahead of time. The encoder only goes one way, and the battery pack should be self explanatory. Use some double stick tape to secure it to the board.


Step - Install the frame to the front PCB if we did not do this for you. You will need some short M2 (2mm) screws.

Step  - Begin by installing the brass standoffs spacers on the pcb. Put them on the front of the main pcb where the lcd screen will be mounted. Use four screws to secure these from behind.

Step - Place the led diffusers on the standoffs. Please Note - the led diffuses have a notch in them, place them back to back with the notces out. The notch should face the pcb and the front panel so that those sit inside the notches.

Next add some double stick tape to the sides of the lcd spacer on both sides. On the side without the notch attach this side to the back of the LCD. The cutrout / notch on the bottom will face the pcb and give some relief for the cable / mounting tab.

Next attach the LCD. Gently slide up the two black tabs on the connector. Put the ribbon cable into the slot and make sure both black tabs are pushed down. If the screen is completly white when the board is powered on it could mean the cable is not seated all the way.

Next secure the lcd to the main pcb in the marked square on the board.

Download the u2f from the releases section of this repo and press the button on the pi while plugging the board into your computer. It should appear as a usb mass storage device. Drag the u2f file onto the drive. The board should disconnect and reboot and the badge should be ready to use!

Finally place the front panel onto the board and secure it with screws.

You now have a fully build badge, congrats!
